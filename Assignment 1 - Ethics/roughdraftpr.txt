What has occured recently in the name of anonymous is not to be a representation of what we all believe in or support.  Anonymous is an idea.  You can not judge an entire group by the actions of one member or one collective of its members.  Do you judge all baptists based on the actions of the Westburro Baptist Church?  I personally do not agree with the actions of BarettBrown in his threats to an FBI agent and/or his family.  I don't agree with money being brought into the equation with the recent scandal involving the tax returns of the the republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.  If a leak is needed to cause change, then that is what should occur, but when money was added as a factor, the anon member became just as corrupt as the men he set out to expose.  For that, I do not support what he did.  Arresting the whistle blowers like Julian Assange will lead to a totalitarian nation.  I am sadly seeing a change in the way our country operates to be more like that of what is depicted in the book 1984.  I stand for freedom of speach- a right which is guaranteed to me in the constitution of the country in which I choose to live and in which I was born.  We need transparency, and we have a few people who are willing to assist the rest of us in achieving that, even if it puts them at risk of criminal prosecution.  You hate corruption, yet you support officials in their decisions to prevent you from knowing just how corrupt they are. Open your eyes America.
